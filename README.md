I am a research scientist studying ice sheets and polar oceans as indicators of climate change. I am formally trained as a computer scientist and earth scientist focusing on polar glacier hydrology and oceanography. I regularly work or have worked in the following areas:

+ *Leading logistically complicated field campaigns* with international stakeholders and participants ranging from multi-national corporations to Ph.D. students.

+ *Collecting data* from high-risk remote field sites such as underneath a glacier, within a crevasse field, or from the ocean at the edge of calving glaciers.

+ *Custom or novel sensor* life-cycle - Design, development, construction, deployment, operation, and field repair/debugging.

+ *Reproducible computational workflows* and scientific publications using open source tools.

+ *Remote sensing* including spacecraft operations and mission control, sensor calibration, and end-user imagery use.

+ *Public outreach* and education including popular press interviews, museum display creation, and speaking engagements on all seven continents from the U.N. General Assembly Room to kindergarten classrooms.
